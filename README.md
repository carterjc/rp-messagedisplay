# rp-messagedisplay
A repository for a likely overengineered project to display messages to a Raspberry Pi

I used this video to connect my RP to a 16x2 display (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XLjVChVgec)

Frontend display created largely in part to the-raspberry-pi-guy (https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd/tree/master/installConfigs)
